## About Me

I am currently working as a data analyst for Bank of America as part of their treasury data management team. Prior to that, I worked at ActiveCare, where I led the Reporting and Analytics team. My work has mainly consisted of using SQL and R to prepare and automate reports and various analyses. 

I began began Georgia Tech's online Master's in Analytics degree in 2020 to continue learning about data science techniques with an expected graduation in August 2022. I received a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics from Brigham Young University in April 2016. While I was a student there, I worked as a research assistant where I co-authored two papers about academic librarians.
