## About Me

I am currently doing contract work for a large financial institution as a data analyst with their treasury data team. Prior to that, I worked at [ActiveCare](https://www.activecare.com/), where I led the Reporting and Analytics team. My work has mainly consisted of using SQL and R to prepare and automate reports and various analyses. 

I received a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics from Brigham Young University in April 2016. While I was a student there, I worked as a research assistant where I co-authored two papers about academic librarians.
