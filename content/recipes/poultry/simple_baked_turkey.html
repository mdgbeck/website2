      2020-11-26 - Baked turkey using this method for 2020 thanksgiving. Turkey was still slightly frozen when going into oven. Worked well - very easy and turkey was still decently moist and tasty at end with no other basting or anything fancy. As we did not have great roasting pan I placed veggies in 9x13 pan and then set wired rack on top with turkey. Also worked pretty well, probably only doable with smaller turkey to make sure to catch all drippings. Drippings went into gravy and that was good too. Image below has odd color, but end result looked better in person.
