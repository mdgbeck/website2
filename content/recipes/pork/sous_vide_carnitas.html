  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2020-06-30 - Cooked 2.2 lbs with same amounts other ingredietns at 185 for around 7.5 hour. Fried shredded pork in lard in cast iron to finish. Flavor pretty plain, "pork" flavor is at the front. Seemed like it needed more fat flavor which is why the added lard to the pan. Sous vide texture was nice, and crisped up nicely as well. Might consider adding other flavor / aromatics when making again.
