  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2021-02-07 - Made two loaves according to recipe above, kneaded in stand mixer. Worked fine in mixer, but was a dense enough dough so pulled away quickly enough I think. Possible could have kneaded a bit more. Cooked first right away and turned out okay. Was decently dense and came out almost like a sweet cinnamon bread. Not overly sweet, but might consider reducing sweetner amounts and cinnamon if looking for a plainer loaf. I froze the second loaf wrapped in plastic wrap and place in bread pan to rise a few days later after thawing in fridge overnight. Never really rose again even after baking. I think yeast may have been on it's last legs, may need to try freezing again with fresher yeast.
