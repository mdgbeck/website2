  <li>2020-07-12 - First time making this dough - happy with result. Used stand mixFirst time making this dough - happy with result. Used stand mFirst time making this dough - happy with result. Used stand mixer to knead, never pulled away from sides since probably not enough dough for size of stand mixer. Kneaded a little more by hand before let rise. Did not roll / toss super thin - came out soft and tender but still plenty of support. Baked two on circular pizza pan with holes, and two on normal baking sheet. Both turned out good and were pretty similar, not sure much of difference between the two, ones on tray maybe slightly more tender but not by much if at all.
