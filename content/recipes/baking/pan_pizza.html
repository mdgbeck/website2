      2020-08-16 - Used base receipe but adapted for shortend time-frame. Pizza came out pretty good, guessing would be better with additional rise time. Used close to 1 1/2 tsp yeast, and kneaded in stand mixer for ~5 minutes. Let rise a little under four hours in warm humid room. Then followed recipe as written.
