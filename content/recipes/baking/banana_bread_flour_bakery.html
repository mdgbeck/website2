  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>210 g (1 2/3 cup) all purpose flour</li>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2020-10-18 - made as above but without walnuts. Turned out good - took over an hour to bake - knife test kept coming up with raw batter. Bananas were just past ripe, bread was nicely sweet and moist, not gummy or overly dense.
