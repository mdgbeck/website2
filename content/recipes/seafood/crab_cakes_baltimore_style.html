      2021-02-14 - Made with <a href="../products/crab_phillips_claw_meat.html">Phillips Claw Meat</a> and halved the recipe, which made a good amount for 2 people. Recipe turned out well, lets crab be center of dish so depends on having nice quality crab. The meat I used was fine for "canned" crab and held up well enough when making the cakes.
