  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2021-01-10 - Made with tofu and <a href='../products/noodles_fresh_rice_block.html'>rice noodle block</a>. Turned out pretty decently - sauce combination needs a little work still. Good noodle texture, pan fried tofu before hand and added near end of cooking, worked out well.

    <li>2021-01-17 - Tried making again with same noodle and Bok Choy instead of the chinese broccoli and did not turn out great - noodles still tasted fine, but bok choy cooked down too much and made it all clumpy.</li>
