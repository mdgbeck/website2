      2020-08-09 - Made for first time following recipe. Used normal datu puti vinegar and patis with two decent size pork chops. Had some sauce left at end, but was very sticky and thick since had mostly reduced away. If more sauce is desired could increase soy in the marinade. Very easy and turned out great.
