      2020-09-14 Made with a bad cut of short ribs, about 1.5 lbs of meat. Used about 2/3 of the remaining ingredient amounts. Meat wasn't great, but sauce worked well. Used a little more soy sauce than original recipe.

      2020-9-15 Tried with boneless short ribs and turned out better. Meat was tender still, and sauce still was good.
