  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2021-02-15 - Made as above. Let started sit around 3 hours before making dough. Tried to knead in stand mixer, but never really pulled away clean from the sides of the bowl. Kneaded some by hand after a while in mixer. Did a bad job forming the ball, but still turned out ok. Bread stayed pretty flat, didn't really get much oven spring. Tasted like fresh french bread still, and made for decent toast and sandwiches.
