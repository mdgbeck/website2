  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2020-11-25 - I've made this pie the traditional way before to good results. I decided to try to make with a dutch apple topping and also turned out well. Recipe calls to dump all apples and juice in, with the idea the tapioca with help thicken into nice sweet syrup. Not sure if dutch topping changed cooking, but found ended up with inside a little on juicy side when I added in all the juice - was not overly soggy, but did not seemed runny than before.
