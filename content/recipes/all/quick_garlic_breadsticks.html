    <li>6 Tbl garlic butter</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine all ingredients except garlic butter and knead until smooth</li>
    <li>Separate into 12 portions. Roll into breadsticks, or tie for garlic knots.</li>
    <li>Let rise for 30 - 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400&deg;</li>
    <li>Bake for 5 - 7 minutes then brush with garlic butter. Bake additional couple minutes, remove and brush with remaining garlic butter.</li>
  
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2020-08-02 - Have made a few times before to better results. Dough seemed very sticky this time, and never pulled away from bowl in stand mixer. Still turned out good, would like to test how a more standard double rise would change results. Quick single rise already gives crisp outside and decently tender inside. Apologies for bad picture.
