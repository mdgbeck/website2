  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1/4 tsp yeast</li>
    <li>1 pound all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 Tbl butter</li>
    <li>3 Tbl sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 Tbl milk</li>
    <li>seasame seeds</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make dough from all ingredients except milk, 1 egg, and sesame seeds. Dough should be sticky, but should not stick to fingers when poking. Let rise until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Punch down and turn out dough onto floured surface and divide into 8 pieces.</li>
    <li>Form each piece into round disc, about 1/2 inch tall. Place onto baking sheet with parchement paper, or silicone mat. Let rise again until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Make egg wash with additional egg and milk, and spread gently on buns after they have risen. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.</li>
    <li>Bake in 375&deg; oven 15 - 17 minutes.</li>

  
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>

      2020-06-20 - Made according to recipe sans sesame seeds. Turned out ok, think I cut the second rise a little too short, and over flattened discs. Buns were too thin, but still had decent taste / texture and larger ones held up to good size burgers.
