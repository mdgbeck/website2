  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    4 large russet potatoes
    1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste
    Â¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
    1 pinch kosher salt to taste
    1/4 cup olive oil, or more to taste
    1 cup chicken broth
    3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste
    2 teaspoons lemon zest
    4 sprigs fresh oregano leaves, or more to taste

  </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
     <li>Cut off long ends of potatoes so they will lay flat - cut in half lengthwise, rinse and dry.</li>
     <li>Place potatoes in oiled baking dish, brushing top with oil as well. Season with salt and peppers.</li>
     <li>Bake in 400&deg; oven for 20 minutes. Remove and flip potatoes, let rest.</li>
     <li>Combine broth, lemon zest and juice. Pour over potatoes and brush any zest off top of potatoes. Stick oregano between potatoes.</li>
     <li>Return to oven and continue to roast flipping every 15 minutes, until desired doneness - 30 - 45 more minutes or so.</li>
     <li>Drizzle more oil and season as needed to serve.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2020-08-30 - made following recipe without oregano sprigs. Were decent - probably could have used additional roasting time to develop more crispness. 1 cup broth seemed a little much for amount of potatoes in 9 x 13 pan, but did mostly cook off, but may have increased cooking time.
