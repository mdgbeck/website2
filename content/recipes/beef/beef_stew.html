  <h3>Notes</h3>

      2020-12-16 - Made this with large "pot roast chuck" from costco - came out good. Original recipe has wine instead of grape juice, and a few other annoying additional steps this skips. Not sure how much difference setting aside veggies makes vs cooking them the whole time, but they did come out good and not overly mushy. I used some open jarred marinara sauce in place of tomato paste this time and seemed to work fine - pretty small amount overall so not sure how much flavor is really added.
